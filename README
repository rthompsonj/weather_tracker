Welcome to a simple weather tracker web app!

To launch this application you will first need to sign up for an account at the following address to obtain an API key:

https://developer.forecast.io/

Once you have obtained your key, create a new python file called "api_key.py" in the root directory of this project, and simply paste your key as the APIKEY variable:

APIKEY = 'YOUR API KEY HERE'


This app assumes a local Mongo database with a standard connection.  To change these variables see mongo_connection.py.
